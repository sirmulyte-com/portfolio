deteriorating cells never protected from uv or dust that rises during draught and settles like it must in entropy she put her trust to make each speck find place to make a trust fall catch herself thinking about the dreams of particles of past (meaning two people together in attraction taking leaps of faith) that drowned in shifting floodgates and communicating vessels failing to settle tears at constant levels while testing how much time has passed since rain was mystic eyes were trusting the laws turn tables and one human hand won’t stop the fall of gravity or even her own loss An Anonym

it gathered during day she opens curtains the day has passed retrieving brightness’ burden at times of day when breakfast means a can of beer she sits in silence overlooking evening semblance the

he ploughs the distant lands ahead A Girl Lost in Time (29 19 2020) in loving memory of rustling cities and their pigeons she draws an image with her dirty fingers of how she misses kissing cheeks for one goodbye like twenty times or picking up the dimes she’d find for luck but only when they are heads up of how she used to try to tame the pigeons with fervour flapping wings collecting karmic seeds for their religions not caring about who she was of how her father left before he found a moment to explain the heads of hogs that hung in all the taverns by the doors of how her memory is so unkempt (she says that pigeons made the mess) presenting patches of past lives she might have only dreamt of how eternal lines of time cascade and days just drip from fingers on an empty page perhaps because

"in Amsterdam,",I graduated with a thesis,“Anticipatory Grief in Light of Søren Kierkegaard and Simone Weil: Making Sense of the Task of Loving the Dying”,"The paper aims to explore the notion of anticipatory grief - a form of emotional trajectory connecting a griever and a dying person - in relation to Søren Aabye Kierkegaard and Simone Weil. The main goal is to see how the philosophers can shed light on the relevance and limits of anticipatory grief. By conducting a literature review, the paper argues that Kierkegaard and Weil can mutually illuminate anticipatory grief as a moral attitude that is born out of love and, through attention, gets directed to those who are about to die. Kierkegaard’s thoughts can elucidate the potential of the concept of anticipatory grief to embody the Christian command to love one’s neighbour as oneself. In light of the duty to love, anticipatory grief gets disclosed as a moral relationship with the dying. In the search for the right ways to carry out this relationship, Weil’s concept of attention provides a method of genuine openness, allowing one to become a neighbour of all dying in affliction. The paper concludes that anticipatory grief can be seen as an integral part of an authentic and caring life, significant in disclosing the value of the dying other."

Tutorial,Using the data.csv table,CSV Structure,"The CSV file data.csv should be structured with four columns representing hierarchical tiers:1. Tier 1: The highest level of the hierarchy.2. Tier 2: Nested under Tier 1.3. Tier 3: Nested under Tier 2.4. Tier 4: Nested under Tier 3. Each row in the CSV represents an item in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined by non-empty cells in each tier, creating a parent-child relationship."
