no one could guess his age<br>
imagine youth in old man’s face<br>
with dripping eyes and eyelids<br>
interfering with his glance<br>
“I read the stars”<br>
he says believing<br>
his sun in leo has engraved<br>
the maple husk that grows in shade<br>
with signs unknown to human race<br>
of how the sky has predetermined fate<br><br>

refuse your doubts<br>
his mimics ask to be heard out<br>
despite the fact that reading stars<br>
is such an egoistic conversation start<br>
the way he tries to barge into the sky<br>
imposing shapes of animals<br>
that crawl through ages in a circle<br>
around the axis of one’s self<br>
is action done not only by some little men<br>
you do that every morning time and time again<br><br>

redialling the focus to the face in front<br>
you see internal cosmos bursting out<br>
for long it navigated esoteric roads<br>
and helped his passengers with horoscopes<br>
“so what’s your sign?”<br>
he asks though knows the answer<br>
and counts to twelve in baritone<br>
the seconds one still has<br>
before the night comes and whelms bones<br>
in raging storms of the unknown<br><br><br>

Now a Woman<br><br>

her glowering morning face in mirror <br>
surface touches traits unseen<br>
each night the old face looses<br>
fights against deteriorating<br>
cells never protected from uv or<br>
dust that rises during draught<br>
and settles like it must<br>
in entropy she put her trust<br>
to make each speck find place<br>
to make a trust fall<br>
catch herself<br>
thinking about the dreams of<br>
particles of past<br>
(meaning two people<br>
together in attraction<br>
taking leaps of faith)<br>
that drowned in<br>
shifting floodgates and communicating<br>
vessels<br>
failing to settle tears at constant levels<br>
while testing how much time has passed<br>
since rain was mystic<br>
eyes were trusting<br>
the laws turn tables and <br>
one human hand won’t stop<br>
the fall of gravity or <br>
even her own loss<br><br><br>

An Anonym<br><br>

truth be told no words are left<br>
his mouth feels odd<br>
volition’s gone<br>
his eyes glare up again<br>
foretelling rain<br>
the sly smile of full moon looks feigned<br><br>

the sound of ice in swirling glass<br>
against the voices of old friends<br>
evokes in him a sense of cold<br>
he doesn’t know how many drinks<br>
or years<br>
it’s been<br>
each day is same<br>
contemptuously people look at him<br>
and say<br>
“you’ve changed”<br><br>

another night when he disclaims<br>
he’s fallen down the drain<br>
together with the deluge<br>
forgetting things he swore to cherish<br>
repeating “three strikes <br>
and I’m out”<br>
although new moon has witnessed<br>
the time that what was supposed to be the last<br><br>

the only words he now remembers from the Bible<br>
(he read the shortened version as a kid)<br>
are guiding him <br>
while raindrops blur his vision<br>
he begs for mercy from his father<br>
son and holy <br>
spirit<br><br><br>

An Insomniac<br><br>

insomnia her dearest friend<br>
makes turning of the same old tape<br>
a gruesome tale<br><br>

a reminiscence <br>
of a journey way down south<br>
comes up in mind<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all matter was to freeze in time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and capture all the broad-leaved trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in zenith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun has stopped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo looked at her from the above <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in love<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all life was still only one thing remained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her unexpected steps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that moved like pebbles thrown aslant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to beat the water surface<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she walked as if she owned her freedom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as Apollo kissed her feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they synchronised <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into one rhythmic breathing<br><br>

the voice of memories appears in songs<br>
in lullabies <br>
for what’s been lost<br><br><br>

She Who Lives on the Fifth Floor<br><br>

at times of day when the sun loses its potency<br>
mosquitos come in flocks <br>
like poplar fluff<br>
and occupy the city <br>
to mock the pale sides of your arms<br><br>

she opens eyes<br>
the day has passed it’s safe to rise<br><br>

at times of day when nine-to-fivers sit in traffic jams<br>
the city beats and pulses turning on its lights<br>
asphalt concrete returns the heat it gathered during day<br><br>

she opens curtains<br>
the day has passed retrieving brightness’ burden<br><br>

at times of day when breakfast <br>
means a can of beer<br>
she sits in silence <br>
overlooking evening semblance<br>
the faces of the tired people hopeful people hopeless people<br>
and those that almost disagree <br>
to be so easily misjudged<br><br>

she bends a finger for a man who back in time<br>
would have completely broken her obsessive heart<br>
for every black stray cat she would have bent to pet<br>
for all the kids in strollers pushchairs buggies<br>
by whom she would have wished to be called ‘ma’<br><br>

at times of day when all her fingers are in fists<br>
the dawn is heralded by garbage trucks<br>
and though the fists have power somewhere deep within<br>
to fight the morning light <br>
(to threaten in at least)<br>
she nonetheless retreats inside<br>
she closes curtains<br>
closes eyes<br>
her hands twitch slightly just before<br>
a dreamless dream takes on<br><br><br>

Stanislav, Age 23<br><br>

a birthmark by his eye<br>
more truthful than one’s eyes could ever be<br>
is turned towards the east<br>
sunken in colour of the wheat<br>
laid out by gusts of wind<br><br>

in motherland<br>
a man must stand as stone<br>
that’s what his father told<br>
to always roll uphill<br>
to hold your shoulders up<br><br>

in nausea of stepping on his own<br>
he now stands as a wooden cross<br>
alone at luring crossroads<br>
where only vagrants come to pray<br>
to gods of early days<br><br>

for once he’s free to go<br>
to not turn back and leave behind<br>
sunflowers by the barn<br>
(they sprouted unexpectedly<br>
pretending to be blooms of fern)<br><br>

he smiles at childish dreams<br>
holds back the tears<br>
the past and future have dissolved<br>
into the daily crumbs of bread<br><br>

he ploughs the distant lands ahead<br><br><br>

A Girl Lost in Time (29 19 2020)<br><br>

in loving memory of rustling cities<br>
and their pigeons<br>
she draws an image<br>
with her dirty fingers<br><br>

of how she misses kissing cheeks<br>
for one goodbye like twenty times<br>
or picking up the dimes she’d find for luck<br>
but only when they are heads up<br><br>

of how she used to try to tame the pigeons<br>
with fervour flapping wings<br>
collecting karmic seeds for their religions<br>
not caring about who she was<br><br>

of how her father left before<br>
he found a moment to explain<br>
the heads of hogs<br>
that hung in all the taverns by the doors<br><br>

of how her memory is so unkempt<br>
(she says that pigeons made the mess)<br>
presenting patches of past lives<br>
she might have only dreamt<br><br>

of how eternal lines of time cascade<br>
and days just drip from fingers on an empty page<br>
perhaps because the frozen image of the self<br>
is made from dust with no god’s help<br>

"in Amsterdam,",I graduated with a thesis,“Anticipatory Grief in Light of Søren Kierkegaard and Simone Weil: Making Sense of the Task of Loving the Dying”,"<a href="/images/capstone.pdf" target="_blank">The paper</a> aims to explore the notion of anticipatory grief - a form of emotional trajectory connecting a griever and a dying person - in relation to Søren Aabye Kierkegaard and Simone Weil. The main goal is to see how the philosophers can shed light on the relevance and limits of anticipatory grief. By conducting a literature review, the paper argues that Kierkegaard and Weil can mutually illuminate anticipatory grief as a moral attitude that is born out of love and, through attention, gets directed to those who are about to die. Kierkegaard’s thoughts can elucidate the potential of the concept of anticipatory grief to embody the Christian command to love one’s neighbour as oneself. In light of the duty to love, anticipatory grief gets disclosed as a moral relationship with the dying. In the search for the right ways to carry out this relationship, Weil’s concept of attention provides a method of genuine openness, allowing one to become a neighbour of all dying in affliction. The paper concludes that anticipatory grief can be seen as an integral part of an authentic and caring life, significant in disclosing the value of the dying other."
